This website uses new features we have learned using javascript such as 'event listeners' and 'local storage' in order to make a responsive and up to date schedule.

The website will use dayjs to give the user and accurate date.

And according to the time the schedule informs you wether a certain timefrime is past, present, or has yet to occur by changing its colors. And save user data.
